I’m S. M. Mohiuddin Khan Shiam. At the heart of my work is a simple goal: to use technology and innovation in ways that improve society.

That mindset began early. As a child, I was drawn to technology and space because they represent possibility, problems worth exploring, ideas worth building, and questions worth chasing with discipline and curiosity.

Today, I carry that same curiosity into research, social service, and long-term impact. I’m committed to supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, with particular attention to education, health, human rights, environmental protection, and animal welfare. I enjoy working across disciplines, because the most meaningful solutions usually sit at the intersection of fields.

Along the way, professional and extracurricular responsibilities helped me develop leadership, communication, and strategic planning skills. Those experiences reinforced my belief that collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning are not “extras”. They are the foundation of doing good work.

I’m grateful to my parents, siblings, and teachers for their support and guidance. Their values shaped how I approach challenges: with humility, perseverance, and kindness.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, playing football, and spending time in the world of Harry Potter. These moments keep me grounded and remind me that growth often comes from reflection.

I believe deeply in the potential of human kindness and the transformative power of innovation. I’m always open to connecting with people who care about building a brighter, more equitable future.
